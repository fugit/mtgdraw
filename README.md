MTG Bash Shell Script
=====================

INFO
----
This is a shell script that I put together while on the plane 
to do test draws of a deck. 

Its pretty horrible and could use a lot of logic and coding fixes. 

But throughing it up here because it works. 

TODO
----
Wow make this thing better. 
Fix logic
Fix bad variable names
bla bla bla

NOTES: 
------
Its a lot harder to write these things with out the internets.
